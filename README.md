# sam-cybernaut

Cybernaut is an arcade game written for the retro Sam Coup√© computer. The graphics and level designs come from a disk by "Silver Sword" sourced via Josef Prokes and advertised in Sam Revival issue 22 by Colin Piggot. All implementation code is by Andrew Collier (and any subsequent contributors as described by GitHub commit history). For more details see Sam Revival magazine issue 26.

You will need a copy of pyz80 to assemble the source files. Also you will need a python interpreter with the PIL (imaging library) installed.

The output of the build is a disk image which can be loaded in SimCoupe or transferred onto floppy disk for loading or real hardware.
